      <h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name Omar I grew up in Mosul-Iraq. Because of the war moved to Erbil where I now live. I am married and have a baby girl. I graduated from the institute of technology in Mosul/department of survey. I work in one of the oil companies in Iraq. I like to read some novels (The Merchant of Venice is one of my favorites).  I am working on to be a good programmer.</p>

<h3>My life before Re:coded</h3>
<p>
	Before i join to re coded I was working in an oil company in the city of Kirkuk after the occupation of the vast areas of my country, including my city and the place of my work moved with my family to the city of Arbil and then began to seek work but to no avail because of the lack of money because of the war.To-found program Re:coded.
</p>
<h3>Re:coded</h3>
<p>
	I joined the program because of my desire to get a job in the local or global market and through my studies found that the world of programming is very big and through which one can develop his skills and keep pace with technology and turn his dreams into reality using simple resources and available.

</p>

<h3>My gool after Re:coded</h3>
<p>I am very keen to practice what I learned from the program and through that I can develop my skill in programming or learn new languages.
I hope that my land will be liberated and back to my city and my business as soon as possible.
I also hope that I can develop my work by taking advantage of what I learned from the program and turning my dreams into reality</p>
