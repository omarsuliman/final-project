          <h2>My Life Before Re:coded</h2>
          <p>
            Before I joined Re:coded I was working in an oil company in the city of Kirkuk. After the occupation of the vast areas of my country, including my city and my place of my work, I moved with my family to the city of Erbil. I began to seek work but there was no availabiity because of the war. I found out about the Re:coded program, and decided to apply.

          <h2>Re:coded</h2>
          <p>
            I joined the program because of my desire to get a job in the local or global market. Through my studies, I found that the world of programming is very big and through which one can develop his skills, keep pace with technology and turn his dreams into reality, using simple resources.

          <h2>My Goal After Re:coded</h2>
          <p>I am very keen to practice what I learned from the program and through that I can develop my skill in programming or learn new languages.
          I hope that my land will be liberated, and I can go back to my city and my business as soon as possible.
          I also hope that I can develop my work by taking advantage of what I learned from the program and turning my dreams into reality.</p>
